Repeating rows are used throughout to provide flexibility in adding as many instances of a weapon, attack, skill, power, advantage, or disadvantage as desired. Changing an Attribute will ripple throughout the character sheet to Skills, Powers, Attack Actions, and Damage if those elements are set to the changed attribute.  Additionally, the ability to bump dice is also available; bumping an attribute will likewise ripple throughout the sheet.  A seperate view is provided for NPC Cast Members and Supporting Cast."
